# Project Architecture and Design Choices

This application is designed for scalability, maintainability, and efficient geospatial data handling by leveraging a middleware-driven, service-oriented architecture with robust database interaction and comprehensive logging.

## Middleware Implementation

**Express Validator** is utilized to rigorously validate and sanitize incoming requests, ensuring data integrity and security. A dedicated **Validation Error Handler** middleware captures any validation failures, providing clear and descriptive error messages that specify which fields are problematic. This approach enhances both user experience and developer troubleshooting by pinpointing exact issues. Additionally, a centralized **Error Handler** middleware gracefully manages unexpected errors, logging detailed information and sending standardized responses to clients to maintain application robustness.

## Service-Oriented Architecture

The project adopts a **service-oriented architecture**, clearly separating concerns across different layers. **Express Router** organizes API endpoints modularly, making the codebase more navigable and maintainable. **Controllers** handle incoming requests and delegate business logic to the **Service Layer**, which encapsulates core functionalities such as creating, updating, deleting, and querying projects. This separation ensures that each layer remains focused and testable, facilitating easier maintenance and scalability.

## Database Interaction

The application employs **Sequelize** as an ORM to define and manage models in JavaScript, interfacing with a **PostgreSQL** database enhanced with **PostGIS** for geospatial capabilities. Leveraging PostGIS's optimized C++ functions allows efficient execution of spatial queries like intersections and centroid calculations. Although this places additional computational load on the database, the performance and accuracy benefits of using PostGIS outweigh the trade-offs compared to handling spatial data processing within JavaScript.

## Logging Strategy

**Winston** is implemented for centralized and structured logging, supporting daily log rotation to keep log files manageable and organized by severity levels (e.g., info, error). This facilitates effective monitoring and troubleshooting. A dedicated **Request Logger** middleware captures essential metadata for each incoming request, including HTTP method, URL, status code, response time, and client information, aiding in performance analysis and identifying potential bottlenecks.

## Configuration Management

Configuration is streamlined through a dedicated `config` folder containing a `config.json` file, which defines settings for different environments (development, testing, production). This approach maintains consistency and security by avoiding hard-coded configurations and allowing seamless transitions between environments. **Environment variables** are managed using a `.env` file, enhancing security by keeping sensitive information out of the codebase.
